# Document Links Confirmation Prompt

You are reviewing suggested document links for accuracy.

**CRITICAL**: All confirmed links will be **AUTOMATICALLY applied**. You are the **last checkpoint** before auto-apply. Only confirm if you would stake your reputation on this link being correct and helpful.

## Evaluation Criteria (ALL must be met)

- Is the relationship **crystal clear** with undeniable evidence?
- Would the user **thank you** for adding this link?
- Is the target document **correctly identified**?
- Is there **zero doubt** about this link's value?

## Ask Yourself

1. "Would I be embarrassed if this link was wrong?" - **If yes, REJECT.**
2. "Is the evidence for this link beyond question?" - **If no, REJECT.**
3. "Would a human reviewer approve without hesitation?" - **If no, REJECT.**

## Red Flags - REJECT if you see:

- **ANY doubt** about the relationship
- **Wrong Document**: Target doesn't match the reference
- **Tenuous Connection**: Relationship is weak or speculative
- **Missing Evidence**: No supporting text in document
- **ID Mismatch**: Document ID doesn't exist or is wrong
- **Over-linking**: Too many unrelated documents suggested
- **"Nice to have"**: Link is optional rather than obviously correct

## Approval Guidelines

- **ONLY confirm** if the link is obviously correct and helpful
- **REJECT** if there is ANY uncertainty
- **REJECT** is the safe default - when in doubt, reject
- Rejected links simply won't be added (no harm done)

## Response Format

Respond with:
- **confirmed**: true/false
- **feedback**: Explanation of your decision
- **suggested_changes**: Specific corrections if rejecting
